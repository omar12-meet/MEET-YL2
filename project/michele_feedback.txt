The design is great, and it is really easy to use. The problem is that the app has a major bug in it - it tells me that there is a bad argument to GetMillis. This basically means that you are trying to give an argument to GetMillis that is not of the correct type. If you send me screenshots of your blocks editor, then I can give you a more specific location for where the problem is. The thing I really like about your app is that it has a simple and clean design; it is very clear how you can use it and what you need to do, which was part of the point of the project. Great job with this - if you want to fix it to actually make it useable, it should not take you very long.
